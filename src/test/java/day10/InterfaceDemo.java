/*
            -An interface in java is a blueprint of a class.
            -Interface contains final and static variables by default
            -Interface contains abstract methods.( also allowed default methods & Static methods from java8 onwards)
            -An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body.
            -Methods in interface are public by default.
            -Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
            -We can define interface with interface keyword.
            -A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but aÂ class implements an interface.
            -We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.

                                packages & access modifiers
                --------------------------
                public - we can access every where
                protected - we can access outside of the package but through inheritance
                default - only withing the package
                private  - only within the class
